<h2>On happiness and pleasure<br>
<font size="2"> [ Posted <a href="http://mircealungu.tumblr.com/post/47280211265"> Sat, 06 Apr 2013 17:29:00</a> ]</font>

<p></p><p>The source of these notes: the <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/matthieu_ricard_on_the_habits_of_happiness.html">buddhist monk on TED</a>.</p>
<p>Happiness and pleasure are two different things: one fleeing, the other constant. Rage, joy, anger, pleasure, these things come and go. Happiness is a long-term thing.</p>
<p>Pleasure is a critical part of happiness. Probably happiness without pleasure can not exist.&nbsp;But there is no equality between the two. Validation: people that destroy themselves using drugs. Validation: the mice that die by pressing the pleasure button.</p>
<p>Distinction: there is nothing wrong with pleasure, only that it should be the cherry on top of the cake. When this goes wrong somebody avoids pleasure at all costs. It’s like saying too much food&nbsp; is bad for you,&nbsp; thusyou will eat no food!</p>
<p>That you should have pleasure with a grain of salt: the higher you climb, the lower you’ll fall after. This is why you want to alternate hardship with pleasure. This a Saint-Exupery-an philosophy.</p><p></p>

<h2>Book Review: Rendezvous with Rama<br>
<font size="2"> [ Posted <a href="http://mircealungu.tumblr.com/post/47262617975"> Sat, 06 Apr 2013 10:22:00</a> ]</font>

<p></p><p>This is the second Arthur C. Clarke book I read and the second that I love. Clarke has the talent of being able to draw the most majestic pictures with the universe as a canvas. If in Childhood’s End he describes the most powerful and disturbing apocalypse, in Rendezvous with Rama he describes a most wondrous seemingly un-inhabited self-sustaining space-faring intelligent ecosystem.</p>
<p>The book is a detailed description of a first exploratory encounter between the humanity and (an artefact of) an intelligent life form and is a science fiction classic.&nbsp;<em><span>From here on there be dragons, and spoilers.</span></em></p>
<div><img alt="image" class="center" src="./mircealungu.tumblr.com-april-2013_files/tumblr_inline_mktr9d4aIp1qz4rgp.jpg" width="360"><p><em>(160.000 light years away, The Large Magellanic Cloud is the third closest galaxy to the Milky Way)</em></p>
</div>
<p>The story focuses on the encounter between humanity as represented by the crew of Endeavor and an alien spacecraft dubbed Rama since the astronomers ran out of the greek deities.&nbsp;<br><br>Rama, cylindrical with a radius of 25km and height of 50&nbsp;km, and rotating with 0.25rpm and thus producing its own gravity, is an Ark which enters the solar system and carries a world which must be made by beings similar to humans as the air inside is breathable and the explorers discover other features not completely foreign for humans: a “cylindrical” sea, agglomerations which look like cities, and later bio-robots or biots which have a form of limited intelligence and are servicing the world.&nbsp;<br><br>The human spacecraft Endeavor that happens to be in a proximal region of space moves in for the rendezvous. The encounter is not violent and from this point of view, the book is so much more satisfying than other “encounter” stories (a la H.G. Wells) in which the protagonists are trigger-happy. The explorers are respectful of the bio-robots they encounter to the point where they do not even try to capture one for studying it until one falls off a cliff and breaks. However, not everybody is friendly as some of the humans that are now living on Mercury are sending a nuclear weapon towards Rama. The Endeavor crew succeeds in dismantling.&nbsp;<br><br>As Jimmy, one of the crew of Endeavor, explores the southern side of the Rama, a ghost-like thing/beeing seems to speed towards Jimmy; he closes his eyes for several seconds telling himself that he only has visions, only to open them again and find no more ghost. Later after he discovers a flower that fascinates him to the point of going to great lengths to collect it. This scene seemed to be an innuendo for something more. Could the ghostly being have discovered the flower inside Jimmy’s memory and then synthesized it? Indeed, the astronauts learn later that the ship has the power of synthesizing things and beings based on blueprints that the crew discovers inside the city-like features on the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br>The Endeavor documents as many of the blueprints as they can find on Rama before they have hurry up and to take off as the cylinder world is speeding towards the Sun, a failed mission going towards self-destruction. However, it turns out that Rama is not auto-destructing but rather uses the gravitational field of the sun together with matter that it sucks from the star to propel itself towards the Great Magellanic cloud.&nbsp;<br><br>Like in other Clarke books, the humans learn that they are not the center of the universe. Rama was not targeted at the solar system for taking over it, or even for encountering humans, but rather for refueling and moving on. </span></p><p></p>

<h2>To Do: Visit Chartres<br>

<p></p><p>About the Cathedral of which Orson Wells, in his F for Fake, is saying:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now this has been standing here for centuries. The premier work of man perhaps in the whole western world and it's without a signature: Chartres. A celebration to God's glory and to the dignity of man. All that's left most artists seem to feel these days, is man. Naked, poor, forked, radish. There aren't any celebrations. Ours, the scientists keep telling us, is a universe, which is disposable. You know it might be just this one anonymous glory of all things, this rich stone forest, this epic chant, this gaiety, this grand choiring shout of affirmation, which we choose when all our cities are dust, to stand intact, to mark where we have been, to testify to what we had it in us, to accomplish. Our works in stone, in paint, in print are spared, some of them for a few decades, or a millennium or two, but everything must finally fall in war or wear away into the ultimate and universal ash. The triumphs and the frauds, the treasures and the fakes. A fact of life. We're going to die. ...Be of good heart,“ cry the dead artists out of the living past. Our songs will all be silenced â€“ but what of it? Go on singing. Maybe a man's name doesn't matter all that much.</p>

<p></p><p></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Am urmÄƒrit seara aceasta un episod din documentarul Memorialul Durerii — È™i anume, cel care Ã®i prezintÄƒ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnX5DjPJvzA"><span class="s2">viaÈ›a lui Corneliu Coposu.</span></a> Il vÄƒzusem pe Coposu la televizor dupÄƒ revoluÈ›ie, dar chipu-i auster È™i ostenit nu mi-a pÄƒrut niciodatÄƒ carismatic. Am Ã®nÈ›eles din nou — pentru a cÃ¢ta oarÄƒ? — cÄƒ nu este bine sÄƒ judeci un om dupÄƒ Ã®nfÄƒÈ›iÈ™are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DacÄƒ Ã®mi este Ã®ngÄƒduit sÄƒ folosesc acest cuvÃ¢nt Ã®n contextul unei istorii tragice, aÈ™ spune chiar cÄƒ a fost reconfortant* sÄƒ vÄƒd interviurile cu el. A fost reconfortant sÄƒ vad demnitatea unui om care a fost Ã®nchis È™i torturat zeci de ani Ã®n Ã®nchisorile comuniste&nbsp; pentru cÄƒ Ã®mpreuna cu alÈ›i romani, nu s-au ghidat dupÄƒ vorba pe care se grÄƒbesc toÈ›i sÄƒ o citeze cÃ¢nd Ã®ncerci sÄƒ faci ceva Ã®ndrÄƒzneÈ› diferit decÃ¢t majoritatea “capul ce se pleacÄƒ, sabia nu-l taie**”. Un om care nu a cedat, Ã®nsÄƒ.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ãn interviuri, Coposu vorbeÈ™te despre È›arÄƒ È™i viziunea sa pentru ea. I se lumineazÄƒ faÈ›a</span>&nbsp;atunci cÃ¢nd vorbeÈ™te despre romÃ¢nii din Basarabia. El nu se laudÄƒ cu “cinstea” sa. Nu Ã®i acuzÄƒ pe toÈ›i comuniÈ™tii laolaltÄƒ, ci doar pe cei care l-au torturat, ba È™i pentru ei ai uneori impresia cÄƒ este gata sÄƒ le gÄƒseascÄƒ un motiv de iertÄƒciune, o scuzÄƒ. FranÈ›a l-a decorat cu legiunea de onoare. “Noi” nu l-am decorat. Ãn schimb, Ã®n confuzia noastrÄƒ “am” trimis minerii la el acasÄƒ.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ãn ultima vreme m-am prea lÄƒsat tÃ¢rÃ¢t Ã®n vÃ¢rtejul articolelor care prezintÄƒ (adesea prea strident, prea unilateral, È™i prea superficial) situaÈ›ia din politica romÃ¢neasca. Am ajuns Ã®nsÄƒ, sÄƒ fiu literalmente dezgustat de sesiunile mele de citit “È™tiri” politice, mai ales atunci cÃ¢nd am citit mai multe articole Ã®ntr-un sitting sau atunci cÃ¢nd am Ã®ncercat sÄƒ citesc atÃ¢t versiunea unei pÄƒrÈ›i cÃ¢t È™i a celeilalte. Ãn documentarul&nbsp; Memorialul Durerii am descoperit o resursÄƒ aproape inepuizabila de “zeamÄƒ de potroace pentru spÄƒlat dezgustul provocat de aceste È™tiri”.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">___</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* Singurul moment Ã®n care am avut un sentiment neplÄƒcut a fost cÃ¢nd am vÄƒzut imaginile de la mineriadele din 90 È™i 91 È™i pe ion iliescu Ã®n acest context mulÈ›umindu-le minerilor pentru Ã®naltul spirit civic. Sunt trist cÃ¢nd ma gÃ¢ndesc cÄƒ un partid care Ã®l are ca &nbsp;preÈ™edinte de onoare pe acelaÈ™i ion iliescu are o majoritate Ã®n parlamentul RomÃ¢niei. Poate de asta l-am votat pe Traian BÄƒsescu, pentru ca el <a href="http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/basescu-a-evitat-sa-dea-mana-cu-iliescu-si-constantinescu-dupa-parada-de-la-arcul-de-triumf-5145025"><span class="s2">nu da mana cu</span></a> ion iliescu.</span></p>

<p></p><p></p><p class="p1">I am back in Arad, my hometown, for a few days. I sit in my parked car, while talking on the phone and observing the world go by.&nbsp;Two people catch my attention.</p>
<p class="p2">A homeless man, a few meters in front of me, sitting on the sidewalk and reaching into a pond on the street to wash his hands and arms. From where I am,&nbsp;I can see&nbsp;the grey dirty water glittering under the hot August sun. I turn my head away. What a miserable conditionâ€¦</p>
<p class="p2">A girl passes by on the sidewalk:&nbsp;blonde hair,&nbsp;incredibly short and tight skirt, strident make-up, golden flip-flops. I instantly recognize what we’d call here a “pitipoanca” - an untranslatable derisive term. I know there's likely not much about her besides her appearance… She looks at the homeless guy and enters a store.</p>
<p class="p2">I finish my phone conversation and go to retrieve some cash.&nbsp;As I exit the bank, the girl comes out of the nearby grocery store with a bottle of water. She goes to the homeless man, talks to him, and then starts pouring water so he can now clean his feet.</p>

<h2>Lessons from the South Pole<br>

<p></p><p>I once read about three of the explorers that attempted to go to the South Pole. Very different people and approaches:</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong> - he set up his base camp more to the north than initially planned. he added one man more to the expedition without increasing supplies. he continued to the south pole even if he realized that he can afford no margin of error on the return trip. he died on the way back together with all the members of his crew.</p>
<p><strong>Shackleton</strong> - although tried several times, he never reached the south pole in his life. at least once he could have made it but did not want to risk. in fact, he never lost anybody from his crew in all his trips.</p>
<p><strong>Amundsen</strong> - he planned thoroughly the expedition. studied both Shackleton's earlier attempts and Inuit techniques. he got to the south pole and returned back safe with his entire crew. in fact, some members of the crew gained weight during the return trip.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Everybody can sing<br>
<font size="2"> [ Posted <a href="http://mircealungu.tumblr.com/post/8285916742"> Sun, 31 Jul 2011 06:41:00</a> ]</font>

<p></p><p>It's 4.46 am and I can't sleep. This has been the most terrible jet-lag I've ever experienced. Maybe the fact that my trip from Los Angeles to Bern took about 48 hours door to door, time in which I couldn't get too much decent sleep is part of the reason I slept the entire first day and stood awake the entire first night. This second night was better: I slept until 3am, but now I am awake again.</p>
<p>So what to do? I started by browsing a little bit Facebook… and then I decided to&nbsp;resurrect my blog.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the reasons why I decided to restart writing is the danger of making my way through the information age by ...liking“ (and more recently ...plusing“) links to funny videos, and random pictures of happy people out of any context. The most creative thing I’ve been writing in a long time are short aphorisms and ideas that rarely go beyond a few sentences. In an age where we are all almost as literate as Dostoievsky (this might be pushing it, but it would be interesting to compare the number of words the great russian read in his lifetime with the number of words an average person has read nowadays) it is a pity that our creative output is sometimes limited to 140 characters.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Sure my essays will never be as well-written as the ones of Fyodor but then again, I don't even aim there, so that’s ok with me.</p>
<p class="p1">This reminds me of a scene in the Johannesburg airport. I was flying back to Europe. The lady that was checking my passport was singing while browsing it. I told her ...you have a good voice“. She laughed at me and said, ...no I don't have a good voice but i like to sing. In fact there is something special about our culture here in South Africa that you should know - we always sing: be it at a wedding, a funeral, a party, or in any other circumstance. Sure, there are many people that can sing beautifully, and some of them make a career out of it. Not everybody can make a living singing, but everybody can sing while living“. I'll never forget that lady - she expressed so well my perspective on music. And on creativity in general.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, one condition for becoming more creative is being able to find the time to do it. And this might mean, reading and following less of the other people’s output and closing your eyes to many things that go around you so you can dedicate time to be creative yourself. But I think it’s worth it.</p>
<p class="p1">If you decide not to read my musings, in order to write your own, I’ll not hold it against you.</p><p></p>
