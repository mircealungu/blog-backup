<p></p><p>Do you remember what happened to your closet when you managed it based on the policy&nbsp;<em>“Is there a chance that I will wear this in the future?”</em>. In a context of abundance a much better closet management criteria is:&nbsp;<em>“I really love and want this”</em>.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="image" src="./drlungu.tumblr.com_files/tumblr_inline_mk7jj2Lq811qz4rgp.jpg"></p>

<p>I think academia is a particularly relevant domain here. As an academic you get to choose with whom you collaborate, on what projects you work, which students you supervise, in what PC’s you participate, what conferences you attend, etc. The options are most of the times limited by your imagination. And the scarce resource of time.</p>
<p>I have accepted <em>being a PC member for OOPSLA</em> in my portfolio of projects for next year. That is going to require two weeks of my spring; then there will be a PC meeting far far away. With Oscar we have decided to organize SATToSE 2013 in Bern, another project in my portfolio. The organization and attendance for workshop will require another two weeks of dedication. There I go, I have pledged a tenth of my 2013 before it even started!&nbsp;</p>
<p>When managing our&nbsp;personal project portfolios in an ambient of abundance, we must follow the advice of HBR:&nbsp;not just haphazardly saying no, but purposefully, deliberately, and strategically eliminating the nonessentials.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>API Deprecation in Software Ecosystems<br>

<p></p><p>In November I have presented with Romain Robbes our paper on API Deprecation at FSE 2012 in North Carolina. I upload here the slides of the presentation:</p>

<p><br>I started the presentation discussing how in real-life ecosystems changes in one part of the ecosystem can have far-reaching impact in other parts. I used the illustration from the Long Now Seminar by Stephen Lansing <a href="http://longnow.org/seminars/02006/feb/13/perfect-order-a-thousand-years-in-bali/">Perfect Order: A Thousand Years in Bali</a></p>
<p>In <a href="http://scg.unibe.ch/scgbib?query=Robb12a&display=abstract">our paper</a> we show that indeed, some deprecations in a given project in a Software Ecosystem can impact hundreds of other projects and developers.</p><p></p>

<h2>Against Beauty Pageants in Software Engineering<br>
<font size="2"> [ Posted <a href="http://drlungu.tumblr.com/post/16761279899"> Mon, 30 Jan 2012 10:14:00</a> ]</font>

<p></p><p><span class="s1">I always liked competitions. In fact, when I started doing research I had a hard time understanding the conference system: “There is no ranking of the papers that are submitted? You just divide them in two piles: the accepted and rejected? But what's the incentive for the people to participate then?“. I guess my amazement was due to the educational system which formed me: in Romania we always encouraged competition and ranking. In school the best three students in every class would get prizes and the next three would get special mentions; the best in a given discipline would participate in ...Olympiads“ in which the aim was to rank as high as you could and in which the ranking was always made public and a matter of pride for the individual and institution; in university the results of the exams were publicly displayed: sometimes the lists were sorted alphabetically, sometimes in based on the grade.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So maybe this is why when we were thinking about the project for the <a href="http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/sde"><span class="s2">Software Design and Evolution course</span></a> at the University of Bern (co-taught with Oscar Nierstrasz), I wanted to have a competition. I thought it would make people work better since they will be part of a competition. But in order to have a ranking, you need a metric for the objective evaluation of each project. And in my experience, the software engineering and software analysis projects are not easily ranked. Or when they are ranked, it is more the ranking of a beauty pageant than the ranking of a sprint contest. And I wanted the ranking to be of the latter kind. And on top of that, the solution to the problem-project should involve and combine as many techniques as possible from the palette that we were going to talk about about in the course. This were the requirements for the problem of the Software Evolution Cup.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We eventually settled on The Dead Code Detector project. The idea is inspired by the observation that usually, the size of the code in a project is monotonically increasing: code gets always added, but it rarely gets deleted; even if often references to individual methods or classes are removed during its evolution, the referenced artifacts still remain in the code base. With time, nobody knows why they are there but nobody dares to remove them either. Having a system that would detect potential dead code would be useful for keeping the code base clean.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some simple situations can be detected by the most advanced IDE's: eclipse highlights fields that are not used, and even functions that are never called. The problem is not trivial though: functions might be called from other projects, two functions that mutually call each other might become dead for the rest of the project, etc. Moreover, a function which might seem to be unreferenced during static analysis might be called through reflection at runtime. In a way, the dead code detector would be a Static Garbage Collector for the source code.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This project allowed us to rank the students with the following ranking function: each team would get a accuracy score equal to the number of lines of code correctly detected as dead code minus the number of lines of code incorrectly detected. In order to reduce our work, we would only consider their top 10 recommendations for the score calculation. With this scoring we could have a ranking for the Software Evolution Cup but we could also grade the project based on its architecture and ingenuity&nbsp;for the final grade independently of the cup ranking. Two rabbits with a single bullet :)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Software Evolution Cup / SDE Project took the next to the last four weeks of the SDE course. We timed it in such a way that in each of the weeks, during the lecture, we introduced a new analysis technique that was directly relevant for the project: static analysis, dynamic analysis, multi-version analysis, ecosystem analysis. At the end, we were pleasantly surprised to see that the winner project had combined all the four techniques we presented. Indeed, the techniques proved as we expected to be complementary:</span></p>
<ol><li>With static analysis one can detect artifacts in the code that are unreferenced&nbsp; but he can never be sure that they are not called through reflection at runtime.</li>
<li>The dynamic analysis complements the results of the static analysis and can infirm some of the results that might have seemed &nbsp;</li>
<li>The historical analysis of the versioning system can highlight methods which are actively worked on but were not detected as live by dynamic analysis, which is inherently incomplete.</li>
<li>Finally, the ecosystem analysis, insures that the API that the project exposes to the other systems in its software ecosystem are also marked as not being dead code.&nbsp;</li>
</ol><p class="p3">The project was successful; we ranked the students and we had a clear winner. When deciding the winner we realized that the ranking has one drawback: we liked more than one project, and we almost felt bad for having to declare a single winner: Olivier FlÃ¼ckiger. Besides his project, there were several others that we liked but if we would have offered prizes for all, almost half the people would have been awarded a prize.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The project was not perfect and we also had some lessons to learn.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul><li>The problem was not that clear as we expected: after all as a benchmark we could only give small systems that we wrote ourselves and in which we intentionally introduced dead code; otherwise we couldn't have evaluated the correctness of the answers.</li>
<li>Not all the answers were black or white: some lines of code were only used by the tests: were they dead or alive?&nbsp;</li>
<li>One of the students wrote a long rant on his personal blog about how he was philosophically against the idea of the project. One of the objections was that one can never be completely sure that a code fragment is completely dead as it can always be called by reflection…</li>
</ul><p>I am still not sure whether the competition context influenced the behavior of the students. I sure it did not demotivate them, and after all we were pleasantly surprised by their overall enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are now thinking about the problem for the next Software Evolution Cup.</span></p>

<h2>Using Twitter in Education<br>

<p></p><p><a title="The effect of Twitter on college student engagement and grades" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2729.2010.00387.x/pdf">The effect of Twitter on college student engagement and grades</a> is an interesting article. It shows through a controlled experiment that using Twitter can enhance the engagement of the students.</p>
<p>In ‘87, Chickering and Gamson proposed 7 principles for good practice in undergrad education: four which I consider the&nbsp; most important are (1) communicate high expectations, (2) foster cooperation between students, (3) student/faculty contact, and (4) provide prompt feedback.</p>
<p>Reading the article one realizes that the faculty performing the study used Twitter&nbsp; to support exactly these requirements. One thing that was obvious from the article is that the faculty were dedicated to invest much more time and continuously monitor the Twitter activity.</p>
<p>The article reminded me of the first years of programming fundamentals group projects at the University of Lugano where we saw students being really engaged. The more I think about it, the more I realize that we had all the 4 principles covered:</p>
<ol><li>Having <a title="Michele" href="http://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/lanza/">Michele</a> as the professor guaranteed that students knew they were up for some high expectations</li>
<li>Having groups that could spend as much time as they wanted in the lab allowed cooperation to happen</li>
<li>Having us, the research assistants pass through the room where the groups worked to get to our offices guaranteed continuous contact.</li>
<li>Our doors were continuously open. This changed after a few years though… but this is another story.</li>
</ol><p>The morale for me? Technology (e.g. twitter) can help when there is dedication, but dedication alone will also do.</p>
